These scripts are for testing VXLAN and LISP tunnels in Open vSwitch (OVS).
The intended scenario is comprised by two virtual machines (192.168.127.1 and
.2) running OVS, and each hosting a VM with statically assigned IPs
(192.168.31.1 and .2) connected to tap0 on the host VMs.

  * `start-ovs`: loads the OVS datapath kernel module and sets up the OVS
    daemons with a clean configuration
  * `stop-ovs`: unloads the OVS kernel module and stops the daemons
  * `vxlan-scenario`: to be run after `start-ovs`, sets up a VXLAN tunnel
    between the host VMs
  * `lisp-scenario`: to be run after `start-ovs`, sets up a LISP tunnel
    between the host VMs
